The top 5 style-colors with the largest sales gain were then identified.","recommendations":"Consider increasing inventory for the top-performing style-colors to meet the rising demand. Additionally, analyze the factors contributing to the sales increase for these products to replicate the success across other style-colors.","request_and_response_issues":"The analysis assumes that the 'period' column is in YYYYMM format and that the sales data is complete and accurate.
